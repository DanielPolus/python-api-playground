# Python API Playground

ðŸ“Œ This repository is for learning and experimentation. The projects are intentionally simple but cover essential backend development concepts.  
The goal is to practice backend development step by step â€” from basic CRUD endpoints to databases, validation, and testing.  
Each project is self-contained inside its own folder.

## Projects
- **Bookmarks API** â€“ simple CRUD service for managing bookmarks with tags, notes, and favorite flag.
- **Todo API** â€“ task manager using SQLite + SQLAlchemy with search and pagination.
- **Expense API** â€“ expense tracking service with categories, currency validation, and filtering (SQLite + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic).
- (More coming soonâ€¦)

## Topics Covered
- FastAPI basics: routes, path/query/body parameters
- Data validation with **Pydantic** (`Field`, `validators`, regex patterns)
- CRUD patterns (create, read, delete)
- Pagination and filtering
- SQLAlchemy ORM + SQLite (relations, foreign keys)
- Automated tests with **pytest** and `TestClient`
- API documentation with **Swagger UI** (`/docs`)

## How to Run a Project
Each project lives in its own folder.  
To run, enter the folder and execute:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
